<h3>What is Autograph?</h3>
<p>
Autograph is a load testing tool that spits out easy to understand HTML reports.  Autograph aims to be the easiest way to get a peek at how your app responds to load.

<h3>Features</h3>
<p>
  <ul class="alist">
    <li>Bulit on the powerful httperf tool</li>
    <li>Generates sexy reports</li>
    <li>Simple to use</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>
  Autograph's testing strategy is rather basic: slam the specified URLs with GETs, and see how they respond.  Here are a few things autograph does NOT do:
  <ul>
    <li>Handle POST, HEAD, PUT, DELETE requests</li>
    <li>Test with specified user-scenarios</li>
    <li>Apply load from multiple servers</li>
    <li>Your laundry</li>
  </ul>
