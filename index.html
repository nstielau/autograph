          Ideally, this graph would be a straight line at 45 degrees; for every request that is sent to the server, it accepts a connection, regardless of how many concurrent requests are made.  Realistically, this graph will start linear and degrade as network or software bottlenecks are hit. The point at which this graph breaks linearity indicates the maximum possible concurrent requests the system can successfully serve.
